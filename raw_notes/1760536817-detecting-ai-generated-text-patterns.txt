Okay, this is less like a direct note to take, and less like an analysis or finding anything needed,
but I think a funny or sort of quirky perspective on what a good LLM for a judge task might be
is looking for text that was submitted to a form or like via an email or whatever
that is clearly generated by an AI.
So like there's a few patterns that are standard used.
Like one is the like M dash is super common, and the other is like it's not X, it's XXXXX
as like just two patterns that are used.
So like looking at patterns of like common AI text would be useful,
but like the general idea is like as an example of when an LLM as a judge could be used
would be like detecting clearly AI generated speech and like looking at responses to it as well.
So something along those lines, this is not fully thought out, but just wanted to get it out there.
