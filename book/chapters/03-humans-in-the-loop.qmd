# Humans in the Loop

## The role of people in evaluations

Human judgment anchors quality thresholds that models cannot self-impose. We describe collaboration patterns between researchers, annotators, and domain experts, and outline strategies for sharing evaluation context without biasing outcomes.

## Getting started

Implementing a human-in-the-loop workflow requires planning for onboarding, tooling, and documentation. Practical checklists help teams move from ad-hoc reviews to a predictable process that scales.

## Golden Data

High-fidelity datasets—often called golden sets—enable continuous benchmarking. We discuss sourcing, maintaining, and versioning this data while protecting privacy and reducing labeling drift.

## Reproducibility

Reproducible evaluations insist on transparent configurations, deterministic prompts, and traceable decision logs. We close with guidance on audit trails and techniques for keeping artifacts discoverable over time.
