# Conformance & Control Checks

## Format Matching

Ensuring outputs comply with expected schemas prevents downstream breakages. This section reviews prompt engineering tricks, structured output requests, and automated validation utilities.

### LLM healing

When model responses deviate from the required format, a secondary "healing" pass can repair the structure without re-running the full task. We explore techniques for building healers that are transparent, measurable, and integrated into CI workflows.

## Routing and Classification

Routing helps direct requests to specialized models or templates, while classification verifies that responses meet policy constraints. We examine decision boundaries, confidence scoring, and fallback strategies.

## Formatting example

The accompanying code sample in `code/formatting_example.py` demonstrates how to detect schema violations and apply corrective transformations before evaluating the result.

## Classification example

The example in `code/classification_example.py` outlines a simple classification harness that records probabilities, applies thresholds, and emits audit-friendly logs.
