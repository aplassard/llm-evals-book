# Foreward

Welcome to *Evaluating LLM Based Applications*. This foreward outlines the journey behind the book, the challenges encountered while building evaluation workflows, and the motivations for sharing them in an open, reproducible format.

The intent is to set the stage for readers who are balancing rapid product delivery with responsible oversight. You will see a recurring theme: evaluations are not a one-time task, but a continuous dialogue between systems and the people who rely on them.
