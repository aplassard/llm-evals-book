  "text_summary": "Chapter focused on two practical LLM application patterns: (1) validating and returning structured data (JSON) so model outputs conform to a programmatic schema, and (2) using LLMs for classification-style tasks (fixed label sets) and evaluating them with standard metrics. Cover prompt design, common output artifacts (preambles, code fences), code-based validation (e.g., pydantic), measurement of schema-conformance rate, and an example project (benchmarks on a small model and an email classification assistant). Include code examples in a repo and a possible cross-reference chapter on prompting strategies and failure-handling.",
  "notes": [
    "Chapter two will cover two linked topics: validating structured data outputs and handling classification tasks with LLMs.",
    "When building LLM applications, the model must often conform to a specific schema (commonly JSON) so downstream systems can consume outputs programmatically.",
    "Common issues with LLM-generated structured outputs include preamble text, code fences (```), extra commentary, and slight deviations from the requested schema.",
    "Prompt should specify the exact JSON format including field names, types, optional fields, and list structures so the model knows the expected schema.",
    "Validate model outputs programmatically (e.g., with pydantic or custom validation code) and report the fraction of outputs that match the schema exactly.",
    "Classification tasks fit naturally into this pattern: include an ID, the classification decision (fixed labels), and optional notes; then validate and evaluate.",
    "Use standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) to quantify performance on classification tasks produced by the model.",
    "Consider a small benchmark with a lightweight model (referred to here as GPT-5 nano) on tasks like sentiment analysis or email classification to demonstrate methods.",
    "Concrete example: an email classification assistant that accepts subject, body, timestamps, thread context, sender, etc., and returns labels such as priority, archive/keep, or requires-response.",
    "Include code examples in the GitHub repo and the book for running validation, measuring schema-conformance rates, and computing classification metrics.",
    "Defer a deeper treatment of prompting strategies and failure-handling (retries, repair) to a separate section or chapter but link to it from this chapter.",
    "Design experiments to measure: schema-conformance percentage, classification metric trade-offs, and effect of prompt tweaks on both conformity and accuracy."
