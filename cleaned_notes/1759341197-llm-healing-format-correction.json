  "text_summary": "The speaker outlines the concept of \"LLM healing\": using an LLM to correct or reformat another LLM's output (for example, repairing malformed JSON) instead of writing exhaustive parsing/logic for every failure mode. The suggested workflow: generate output, attempt to parse/validate (e.g., JSON schema), on parse failure pass the expected format, the actual response, and the parse error to a healer LLM which returns a corrected, strictly formatted response. The speaker proposes including a brief aside and an example of this technique in a chapter, and notes the approach saves writing many ad hoc parsers but has trade-offs to consider.",

    "LLM healing = use an LLM to repair another LLM's output rather than building exhaustive parsing logic.",
    "Typical workflow: have LLM produce output -> try to parse/validate against expected format (e.g., JSON) -> if parse fails, send expected format, actual output, and parser error to a healer LLM -> healer returns corrected output in the required format.",
    "Healing is especially applicable for structure/formatting errors (JSON, code snippets, CSV) where the content intent is present but the structure is broken.",
    "The healer LLM should be prompted to return only the corrected structured output (no extra explanation) to simplify downstream parsing.",
    "This approach avoids handling every imaginable malformed-case explicitly in code; healer LLMs absorb many error-correction cases.",
    "Include a short example/demonstration in the chapter to show the healing loop in practice.",
    "Implementation will need prompt templates, the expected schema or format, captured parser errors, and a clear instruction to output only the corrected format.",
    "Consider integrating with existing validators (jsonschema, strict parsers) so healing only triggers on concrete parse failures.",
    "Potential downsides: additional latency and cost from extra LLM calls, residual hallucination risk, and cases where the healer introduces new errors.",
    "Plan for monitoring and fallback behavior when healing fails (retry, escalate to deterministic logic, or surface an error).",
    "Discuss alternatives and complements: function-calling APIs, typed endpoint enforcement, explicit output parsers, and pre-structured prompts that reduce errors upfront."
