  "text_summary": "LLM healing is a pattern where one LLM corrects or repairs the output of another LLM (or the same LLM) instead of building exhaustive structured logic to handle all output failures. Typical workflow: primary LLM emits a response; you try to parse it into the expected format (e.g., JSON); if parsing fails, you send the expected schema/format, the raw response, and the parsing error to a healer LLM that returns a corrected output adhering to the format. This approach simplifies handling formatting/structural errors and can be presented as a brief aside in a chapter, ideally with a short example or demo.",
  "notes": [
    "LLM healing uses an LLM as a post-processor to fix formatting and structural errors in another LLM's output.",
    "Workflow: generate output → attempt to parse (e.g., JSON) → on parse failure, send expected format, actual output, and parse errors to a healer LLM → receive corrected output.",
    "The healer should ideally return only the corrected code/format to minimize downstream parsing complexity.",
    "This approach avoids constructing exhaustive parsing logic for every possible malformed response.",
    "LLM healing is particularly useful for enforcing strict output schemas like JSON, CSV, or application-specific formats.",
    "You should check how widespread the term/concept is and find prior art or similar patterns (self-correction, iterative refinement, output repair).",
    "Include a concise aside in the chapter describing the concept and a short example that demonstrates a parse failure and subsequent healing.",
    "Consider testing a live example to validate the approach and record common failure cases for documentation."
