  "text_summary": "The speaker outlines a chapter on the role of humans in evaluating LM-based applications. Humans are critical for understanding system requirements, defining quantitative constraints, and interpreting trade-offs between latency, cost, and quality. LMs can increase efficiency (automate manual work), improve accuracy (process large amounts of information, retrieval/context-window benefits), and affect system decision-making. Human review of logs and interactions (including multi-call workflows and tool use) reveals failure modes (extra tool calls, unnecessary turns) and informs what to measure. Even single-turn apps benefit from human inspection to refine prompts, context, and tagging behavior (example: email routing and tagging). The speaker emphasizes measuring reproducibility for ambiguous metrics via interrater agreement (Cohen's kappa mentioned) and recommends researching suitable interrater reliability metrics and how to apply them in LM evaluation.",
  "notes": [
    "Humans should define system requirements, desired behavior, and quantitative constraints for LM-based applications.",
    "Key measurable characteristics: latency, cost, and quality; trade-offs between them must be explicitly understood.",
    "LMs introduce a stochastic layer similar to other ML systems; their effects typically fall into efficiency gains, accuracy improvements, or altered decision-making/workflow dynamics.",
    "Efficiency: LMs can remove manual work and improve throughput; human oversight clarifies where automation is appropriate.",
    "Accuracy: LMs can consume and synthesize large amounts of information quickly; retrieval/context-window design ties to accuracy, latency, and cost.",
    "Needle-in-a-haystack retrieval problems and long-context/text-window strategies are relevant to accuracy and should be considered.",
    "Observability of runtime behavior (logs, turn-by-turn traces, tool calls) is essential to diagnose where systems succeed or fail.",
    "Common failure modes include unnecessary tool calls or extra dialog turns; these become measurable metrics after inspection.",
    "Human-in-the-loop review remains valuable even for single-turn tasks to understand decisions and to refine prompts and context.",
    "Example application: email assistantâ€”humans should check priority routing, consistent recognition of the boss, and multi-tagging correctness.",
    "Manual review of outputs identifies missing tags or recurring errors and informs what automated measures to track.",
    "Reproducibility and interrater agreement matter for ambiguous or subjective metrics; measure how consistently different humans label the same outputs.",
    "Cohen's kappa was mentioned as a potential interrater metric; other metrics (Krippendorff's alpha, Fleiss' kappa) should be considered.",
    "For important subjective metrics, gather multi-reviewer labels to estimate human agreement and set realistic performance guardrails for models.",
    "Actionable evaluation requires combining standard statistical metrics with qualitative human insights from targeted review sessions."
