  "text_summary": "The speaker proposes an \"LLM healing\" pattern: instead of building exhaustive structured logic to guarantee perfectly formatted outputs, let the LLM produce an answer, attempt to parse/validate it (for example as JSON), and if parsing fails send the original output plus the expected format back to the model (the \"healer\") to correct the formatting. The healed result is then returned. The idea is to rely on the model to fix its own formatting errors rather than pre-coding every corner case; an example for a chapter would be helpful.",
  "notes": [
    "LLM healing = using the model to repair its own output rather than encoding exhaustive parser logic.",
    "Typical workflow: LLM produces a response; attempt to parse/validate (e.g., parse JSON); on failure, submit the original output plus the expected format to an LLM healer and request corrected output; return only the corrected, properly formatted result.",
    "This avoids trying to handle every possible output mistake with manual logic and can simplify handling of formatting errors.",
    "Implementation requires reliable detection of parse/format failures and a prompt that clearly conveys the expected schema to the healer.",
    "Potential issues: LLMs can still produce silly or incorrect corrections; healing can mask semantic errors if only formatting is fixed.",
    "Use cases: when the output must match a strict machine-readable schema (JSON, YAML, CSV, etc.) and small format fixes suffice.",
    "For a chapter aside, include a concise, runnable example (pseudocode or minimal code) showing the produce-validate-heal-return loop.",
    "Log both the original failure and healed result for debugging and to detect systematic healing failures.",
    "Consider fallback strategies if the healer cannot produce a valid result (retry with clarifying instructions, stricter schema enforcement, or reject and escalate).",
    "Frame the pattern as a pragmatic tradeoff: less upfront engineering for handling edge cases, with reliance on model reliability and monitoring."
