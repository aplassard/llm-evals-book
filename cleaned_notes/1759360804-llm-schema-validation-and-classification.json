  "text_summary": "Plan chapter content on two related structured-data use cases for LLM applications: (1) validating and enforcing returned structured data (commonly JSON) so model outputs conform to a schema, and (2) applying LLMs to classification-style tasks (e.g., sentiment, email triage) using that validated format. Include practical validation workflows (pydantic or code-based), metrics for measuring schema conformance, classification evaluation (accuracy, precision/recall/F1), a simple benchmark example (small model like GPT-5 nano), and a worked email-classification example. Provide code examples in a GitHub repo and a cross-reference to a prompting strategies section to improve performance. Consider failure handling and re-prompting strategies in a follow-up recording or chapter.",
  "notes": [
    "Chapter focuses on two topics: validating/returning structured data and handling classification-style tasks with LLMs.",
    "Most production LLM applications require the model to output a specific schema (JSON is a common choice) so downstream systems can consume the result.",
    "LLMs often deviate from requested formats by adding preamble text, code fences, or other noise; outputs must be validated and cleaned.",
    "Validation can be implemented in code with schema validators or data-aware classes (example: pydantic) to enforce field types, required/optional fields, and lists.",
    "Measure percent schema-conformance (e.g., 'model matches schema X% of the time') as an output of the validation step.",
    "Classification tasks fit naturally into validated schemas: include task ID, classification label, and optional notes; use validation to filter/score outputs.",
    "Evaluate classification outputs with standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) and run simple benchmarks with smaller models (example suggested: GPT-5 nano).",
    "Include a concrete email-classification example: input fields (subject, body, timestamp, thread, sender), output decisions (priority, archive, requires response), and taxonomy of labels.",
    "Provide code examples and runnable demos in a GitHub repo and include example expected responses in the book.",
    "Defer detailed failure-handling strategies (retries, canonicalization, parsing heuristics, re-prompting) to the next recording or a later section.",
    "Consider adding a dedicated chapter or section on prompting strategies to improve schema conformance and classification performance."
