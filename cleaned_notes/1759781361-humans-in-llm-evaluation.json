  "text_summary": "The speaker plans a chapter about the role of humans in evaluating LLM-based applications. Humans are essential for understanding system requirements, defining quantitative constraints (latency, cost, quality), and making trade-offs. LLMs function as a stochastic layer that can (1) increase efficiency by removing manual work, (2) improve accuracy by consuming large context and surfacing relevant info, and (3) participate in complex agentic workflows requiring inspection. Human review of logs and interactions reveals failure modes (excess tool calls, extra turns, missing tags, mis-prioritized emails) and informs what to measure. Even single-turn apps benefit from human-in-the-loop review to refine prompting and context. Reproducibility and inter-rater agreement are important for ambiguous metrics; measures like Cohen's kappa and other agreement statistics should be researched and applied. The speaker also flagged context-window trade-offs (latency, cost, needle-in-the-haystack issues) as a related area to investigate.",
