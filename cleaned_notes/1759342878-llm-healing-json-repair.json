  "text_summary": "Speaker proposes the concept of \"LLM healing\": using an LLM (or a second LLM acting as a healer) to correct formatting and structural errors produced by the primary LLM output instead of building exhaustive structured logic. Workflow: primary LLM generates a response, attempt to parse (e.g., as JSON); if parsing fails, send the broken output plus the expected format to a healer LLM to produce corrected output; return the corrected code/format. This approach reduces the need to handle every corner case with rigid logic. The speaker suggests adding a brief example in a chapter to illustrate the method.",
  "notes": [
    "LLM healing is the idea of using an LLM to automatically correct its own output errors rather than relying on exhaustive hard-coded logic.",
    "Typical workflow: primary LLM generates an output; attempt to parse/validate (for example, parse JSON); if validation fails, pass both the expected format and the flawed output to a healer LLM to fix formatting errors.",
    "The healer LLM should return only the corrected code or properly formatted result at the end.",
    "This method focuses on correcting structural/formatting issues rather than re-engineering logic to cover every case.",
    "LLM outputs can be silly, wrong, or malformed; the healing approach accepts that and uses the model to repair errors.",
    "The approach can be framed as a lightweight wrapper that validates outputs and triggers a fix-only prompt when needed.",
    "An example demonstrating parsing-fail -> healer-fix -> corrected JSON would be a useful aside in a chapter.",
    "Consider trade-offs: latency, token costs, possible repeated failures, and the need to design robust healer prompts.",
    "Validation step should capture parse errors and provide clear instructions and the expected schema to the healer.",
    "The healer should be constrained to only fix formatting/structural problems and avoid adding new content or changing semantics."
