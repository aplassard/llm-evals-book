  "text_summary": "The speaker outlines a chapter/section about the role of data in LLM-based applications, emphasizing that while data drove model training and capability advances (e.g., MNIST, ImageNet/AlexNet), practitioners building applications need different evaluation thinking. Benchmarks enabled research progress but do not directly answer whether a model will solve a particular application task. Practitioners should build feedback loops, observability, and cost/performance tracking for their apps. Historical examples (MNIST, Hinton 2006, ImageNet/AlexNet) and a commentary that new datasets often drive progress are proposed as motivating material. The speaker plans to contrast benchmark-driven progress with the limitations of benchmarks for real-world application requirements (e.g., managerial advice, coding tasks not well represented in standard datasets like GSM8K).",
  "notes": [
    "Data is central to building LLM-based applications, but the average practitioner is not training base models; they are building on top of them.",
    "Practitioners need feedback loops and observability to understand model cost, performance gaps, and where to focus improvements.",
    "Historical evaluation datasets played a pivotal role in advancing capabilities and framing what models could do.",
    "MNIST (handwritten digits) served as an early benchmark that drove decades of research and was highlighted in Hinton's 2006 Science paper.",
    "ImageNet and the AlexNet result demonstrated how a large dataset plus GPU training unlocked convolutional networks at scale.",
    "A useful motivating quote/article idea: many breakthroughs come from new datasets more than new algorithms.",
    "Text benchmarks for language models exist and drove progress, but the speaker wants to include at least one text benchmark example relevant to LMs.",
    "Benchmarks often fail to represent real application needs; success on a benchmark does not guarantee ability to perform specific job tasks.",
    "Examples of misalignment: managerial guidance, domain-specific code writing, or other niche tasks that are underrepresented in standard benchmarks like GSM8K.",
    "The section should motivate why evaluating at the application level (custom tests, continuous evaluation) is necessary and give practitioners practical evaluation guidance."
