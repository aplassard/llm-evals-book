  "text_summary": "The speaker proposes a pattern called \"LLM healing\": instead of building exhaustive structured logic to guarantee output formats, let the LLM produce a response and then detect/validate the format (e.g., JSON). If validation fails, send the original output plus the expected schema/format back to a separate LLM \"healer\" prompt that corrects formatting/errors and returns the properly structured result. The speaker suggests this as a short aside in a chapter and wants to add an example to demonstrate the pattern.",
  "notes": [
    "LLM healing is a post-processing pattern where an LLM is used to fix its own formatting and structure errors rather than relying on exhaustive validation code.",
    "Typical workflow: primary LLM generates output -> attempt to parse/validate (e.g., JSON) -> if parsing fails, send both the expected schema and the raw output back to a healing prompt -> healer LLM returns corrected structured output.",
    "The approach reduces the need to anticipate every possible error case in program logic by delegating correction to the LLM.",
    "The healer should receive the expected format/schema and the faulty output; it should return only the corrected code/data in the required format.",
    "This pattern is especially useful when expecting strict formats (JSON, code snippets, CSV) and when building exhaustive parsers is costly.",
    "Need an example (real or synthetic) to include as a brief aside in a chapter to illustrate the pattern working (or failing).",
    "Consider edge cases: hallucinations, partial correctness, data loss, infinite cycles of re-healing, and malicious or adversarial outputs.",
    "Decide whether to use one LLM with an internal 'healer' prompt, two separate models, or an orchestrator that calls the same model twice.",
    "Consider automatic detection: what constitutes a parse failure vs. a nuanced semantic error that needs different handling?",
    "Implementation details to clarify: prompt templates for healer, schema representation (jsonschema, protobuf, type hints), maximum repair attempts, and logging/auditing of healed changes."
