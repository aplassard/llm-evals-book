  "text_summary": "The speaker outlines a chapter on the role of humans in evaluating language-model-based applications. Key human responsibilities are: defining system requirements and measurable constraints (latency, cost, quality), inspecting multi-turn logs and system dynamics to discover failure modes and measurement points, manually reviewing outputs even for single-turn tasks to refine prompts and context, and measuring reproducibility for ambiguous or subjective metrics (interrater reliability). The speaker suggests diving into interrater reproducibility metrics (e.g., Cohen's kappa) and collecting concrete guidance and examples for design and measurement.",
  "notes": [
    "Humans are essential for understanding the system, defining requirements, and translating qualitative expectations into quantitative constraints.",
    "Core measurable characteristics to define and monitor are latency, cost, and quality; trade-offs among them must be understood.",
    "LM-based applications often introduce a stochastic layer that can (1) increase efficiency by automating manual work, (2) improve accuracy by consuming and processing large amounts of information, or (3) support decision-making and tool use in workflows.",
    "Context window size affects accuracy, latency, and cost and ties into needle-in-a-haystack retrieval problems for large context inputs.",
    "Observing runtime behavior (logs, multi-turn traces) reveals where the system works or fails and surfaces specific things to measure (e.g., unnecessary tool calls, extra turns).",
    "Manual review of examples helps identify practical issues such as incorrect priority assignment in an email assistant or missing tags in a tagging workflow.",
    "Even single-turn applications benefit from human-in-the-loop review to understand model decisions and design better prompts and context.",
    "When a metric is subjective or ambiguous, measure interrater reproducibility by having multiple humans label the same outputs and compute agreement statistics.",
    "Interrater reliability metrics (the speaker mentioned Cohen's kappa) are relevant and should be researched to find the best-fit measures for LM applications.",
    "Design decisions that follow from human review include adding measurements (e.g., number of tool calls), changing prompt/context, and setting operational guardrails.",
    "Sampling strategy for human review and the frequency of manual audits are important design choices to surface rare failure modes.",
    "Concrete examples (like an email routing/tagging assistant) are useful for illustrating how humans discover edge cases and define metrics.",
    "Reproducibility and agreement thresholds should be used to set expectations for model performance on ambiguous tasks.",
    "Standard statistics and measurement techniques exist, but applying them requires tailoring to the specific LM workflow and ambiguity level."
