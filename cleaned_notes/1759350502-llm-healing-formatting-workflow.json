  "text_summary": "The speaker describes an \"LLM healing\" pattern: instead of building exhaustive structured parsing and error-handling logic, use a language model to correct its own formatting or parsing errors. The workflow is: LLM produces output, attempt to parse (for example as JSON); if parsing fails, send the raw output plus the expected format back to an LLM \"healer\" prompt that corrects the formatting and returns the valid structured result. This approach reduces the need to anticipate every failure case. The speaker suggests including a brief example in a chapter and wants to research and possibly demonstrate the technique.",

    "LLM healing is a pattern where an LLM corrects its own formatting and parsing errors instead of relying on exhaustive external logic.",
    "Typical workflow: LLM generates output; attempt to parse the output (e.g., JSON); if parsing fails, send both the expected schema and the model output to a corrective prompt or healer model to produce valid structured output.",
    "The healer step returns only the corrected code or correctly formatted result, simplifying downstream consumption.",
    "This avoids building complex, brittle logic that tries to handle every possible silly or wrong LLM response.",
    "The approach assumes the LLM can reliably rewrite or reformat its previous output when guided with the expected schema and the original content.",
    "Potential chapter inclusion: a short aside describing the concept and a concrete example showing the parse-fail -> healer -> corrected output flow.",
    "Need to dig into the concept more generally: reliability bounds, when it works, failure modes, and any known implementations or best practices.",
    "Consider an actual runnable example to demonstrate success and limitations (e.g., LLM produces malformed JSON, healer fixes it).",
    "Be aware of risks: healer could still hallucinate or change semantic content while fixing format; need validation and tests.",
    "Implementation considerations: whether to use the same model for generation and healing, prompt design for the healer, timeout and retry policies, and logging of original vs healed output."
