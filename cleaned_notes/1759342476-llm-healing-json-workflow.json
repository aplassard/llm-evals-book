  "text_summary": "The speaker outlines a concept called \"LLM healing\": instead of building exhaustive structured logic to force an LLM into a perfectly formatted output, let the LLM produce a response, attempt to parse it (for example as JSON), and if parsing fails send the original response plus the expected format and the parse error back to an LLM 'healer' prompt that corrects formatting/errors and returns only the corrected result. This is proposed as a pragmatic alternative to hard-coded parsers and enumerating every edge case. The speaker is unsure about details and wants to research the concept and produce a short example for a chapter.",
  "notes": [
    "LLM healing = using an LLM to fix its own output errors rather than prebuilding exhaustive validation logic.",
    "Typical workflow: LLM generates response; system attempts to parse expected format (e.g., JSON); if parsing fails, send original response, expected format, and parse error to a healer prompt; healer returns corrected, properly formatted output.",
    "The approach focuses on correcting formatting/structural errors (like malformed JSON) rather than covering every semantic edge case in code.",
    "This reduces engineering effort for every possible failure mode by leveraging the LLM's ability to rewrite to a target format.",
    "Potential advantages: simpler system-level logic, less brittle format enforcement, easier to support varied outputs.",
    "Potential risks and failure modes: healer could hallucinate, fail to truly correct semantics, introduce new errors, or loop; costs and latency may increase due to extra LLM calls.",
    "Need to define guardrails to avoid infinite heal loops and to detect when automatic healing fails.",
    "Author plans to include this as a brief aside in a chapter and would like to produce a working example to demonstrate the idea.",
    "Research is needed to ground the idea in prior work and to collect best practices for prompts, parse-detection, and retry logic."
