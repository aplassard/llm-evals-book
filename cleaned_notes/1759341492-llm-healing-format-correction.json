  "text_summary": "LLM healing is the practice of using an LLM to correct or reformat its own output rather than building exhaustive external parsing logic. The common workflow: generate a response, attempt to parse it (for example as JSON), detect parsing/formatting errors, then send the original response plus the expected schema and the parsing error to a 'healer' LLM prompt which returns corrected output in the required format. The method is especially useful for formatting-only errors and can be described briefly as an aside in a chapter, ideally with a short example or demonstration.",
  "notes": [
    "LLM healing uses an LLM to correct formatting or structural errors in an LLM-generated response instead of hand-coding many parsing rules.",
    "Typical workflow: LLM generates response -> attempt to parse as JSON (or expected structure) -> if parsing fails, pass expected format, actual response, and parse error to healer LLM -> healer returns corrected output in the required format.",
    "LLM healing focuses on post-hoc correction for formatting problems rather than trying to anticipate every failure case in parsing logic.",
    "This approach reduces the need to implement exhaustive parsing fallbacks for every possible malformed output.",
    "LLM healing is most appropriate for formatting/structure errors; content hallucination or logic errors may require different strategies.",
    "Include LLM healing as a brief aside in the chapter with a short example if possible to illustrate the workflow.",
    "An example implementation would try to return only the corrected JSON (or code) from the healer to keep downstream parsing simple.",
    "Consider discussing trade-offs such as latency, cost of an extra call, and when to prefer function-calling / stricter schema enforcement instead."
